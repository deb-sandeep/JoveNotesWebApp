Pending dev cards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. In notes index.php - check if the request parameter chapterId is present.
  If not return an error message or something. Same for flashcard page too.
. Responsive headers - responsive headers are really not working. Change them 
  to static non-floating headers
        
================================================================================
Completed

6/23/15 --
. Audio questions for hindi alphabets - think and implement.
. Learning efficiency recomputation
. BUG - Notes filtering was not happening because of repeated $sce transformation.
. Usability - push question and answer buttons moved towards grading buttons
. Usability - Points earned and lost in a session are shown on the flash card

6/22/15 --
. BUG - Latest score for a time marker should include the time marker. Bug was 
  evident in scenarios where we have immediately refreshed the chart following
  a manual point addition. It used to show the previous total score.
. Realization - If we manually (via SQL) add remote points to student_score,
  the TOT value needs to be manually adjusted.
. Reduce 150 points from student score for Deba manually (SQL)
. Feature - support for {{@doc ...}} types
. Feature - support for arbitrary media files with spaces in them
. Package JNP, publish to Op, recompile
. syncdevop for the feature additions
. {{@audio ..}} render enhancements - now shows a single glyphicon button


6/21/15 --
. Provided a manual refresh button on dashboard reports
. Provision for manually adding points for a user
. Fixed inconsistent behavior with delay in refreshing values after manual 
  addition of points
. Added a auto refresh button to the report
. Ability to repeat the scores. Don't want to club scores as they show up as a 
  huge spike in intra day graphs.

6/20/15 --
. BUG - Word meaning did not interprete the HTML, use ng-bind-html
. Feature - Spell bee keyboard should have a space bar for disjoint words like
            'non living', 'human beings'
. Support for {{@audio ..}} tag
. BUG - WM did not take formatted words
. Chemical equation latex modification for blanks
. Support for audio tags while formatting text
. Feature - Report delta in time frame

6/18/15 --
. Score report implemented (UI + API + Data access)

6/17/15 --
. More rgraph libraries added

6/16/15 --
. Feature - enhanced score capture, to prepare for temporal reporting and
  catering for score adjustments such as redemption etc.
. Integrated date picker and did POC for integrating into reports page
. Feature - If we are pushing a question manually, purge all the alerts.

6/15/15 --
. Feature - the number of spaced sequenced repetition matured cards are displayed
  in the dashboard. This will help zero down on the relevant chapter without 
  first to flash card and then figuring out that we don't have anything to study
  today.
. BUG - Sorting (objective/subjective) not working if cards are only NS
. Feature - tightened the scoring further (increased penalties)

6/14/15 --
. Increase the font size of spellbee keyboard
. BUG - Shuffle cards logic fix. Shuffling the remaining cards from index 1 to
  length-1. Index 0 is the current card. If we shuffle from index 0, the 
  current card will get back into the deck.
. Feature - key press sound added to spell bee dynamic question

6/13/15 --
. BUG - question change trigger for remote flash was missed out. Fixed that.
. BUG - reset points earned and lost in remote flash card page, whenever a 
  session is starting
. Change unique object id logig for FIB, Matching, Imglabel.. 

6/12/15 --
. Harden logic - If grade card API fails, push again.. after a threshold if 
  push is still not going through, then show a manual button.
. Push button for questions - there are occations where the push API call fails,
  think of either retrying the call or providing a push button to manually push
  the question
. Review computation of scores
  - If in the same session an answer is wronged more than once - marks should be
    deducted - think through this requirement. Need clear articulation before
    implementing
  - If in session n, a card has moved to L0. If in session n+1, the user fails on
    a card in L0, marks should be deducted.
. BUG - If the last question in the session is answered H and it goes back into
  the session, the currentQuestion watch doesn't fire, hence the last question
  never gets rendered. Actually the old one gets rendered which has already 
  been operated upon. This is very visible in case of dynamic questions like
  matching since the question shown is not operable and preserves the state of
  the last attempt.


6/11/15 --
. JNP - Text process FIB inputs to take care of any latex expressions
. Web - FIB answers are no longer embraced by <code> - it makes MathJax expression 
  fail. New class fib_answer added
. Make latex matching regular expressions non-greedy
. Logging enhancements both at server and client side
. BUG - Check the remote flash page elapsed time badge just in case of new cards
  . It is not showing despite cache cleans

6/10/15 --
. BUG - Can't store chapter specific cookies on a generic page. Browser ends up 
  shovelling everything to the server and after a time, the cumulative size of 
  those cookies exceeds 4K and the server returns a bad request. Changed the
  preference notes and studyCriteria to be generic across all chapters.
. BUG - Purge card not working. Purge was not shifting the card list.

  adjusted
. Convert the chapter name link to notes and change the notes icon to statistics
  icon - more usable
. In remote flash card, the graphs are getting overwritten. O should clear the
  canvas before drawing graphs
. More meaningful alert when GradeCard API call fails.

6/7/15 --
. BUG - Elapsed time is not showing on flashcard practice page
  - Bug of unknown order - maybe a typo, cut & paste from remote flash seems to
    have fixed it. RC not found.

6/6/15 --
. BUG FIX
  - For chemical compounds whose chemical names was blank, no question should be 
    generated which involves chemical name. The fix applied yesterday was 
    incomplete and today it has been fixed to satisfaction.
. JNP - Logging differentiated to be more meaningful both at info and debug level
. jnp launch script of DellOp can now take jnprocessor cmd line flags. This is
  especially useful if jnprocessor has to be launched with -f to force process
  all source files.

6/5/15 --

6/4/15 --
. BUG - Markdown processor had ANCHORLINKS turned on, which was converting # [0-9]*
  to anchor links. Clicking these links was causing the page to autoload, spoiling
  the session. Turned off the ANCHORLINKS behavior.
. Create Munni's id and entitlement for JoveNotes
. Created a simple lession for Munni and tested the entitlement behavior 
. MEGA BUG - Refresh card_learning_session was wrongly implemented. Changed the 
  query. Three hours of struggle to zero in and fix the bug.
. Changed grammar to introduce 'hide' for each notes element. This will cause
  the notes element to get filtered out from view. Especially useful in case
  the same note element is being shown in multiple ways, for example word meaning
  are also shown as associations if the same is a part of matching.
. Dell OptiPlex setup
  - DB setup - export import, including entitlements
  - Install jovenotesprocessor on Dell Optiplex. Massive problems with ANTLR 
    version conflict. Took me nearly half a day to find a work around.. sucks!
  - Script to check out from Git and execute jovenotesprocessor
  - Remember to php.ini encoding on Dell Opt for UTF-8
  - scp jovenotes plugins to dell optiplex
  - Softlink JoveNotesEditor.tar to www root

  it from the session (next action > 0). In such a case, should the user be
  - Allowed to score points for subsequent ratings?
    - No, points are scored only on the first attempt. Subsequent attempts are
      for practice and since short term memory kicks in, it is not a fair test
