. Implement user values in FlashCardAPI response
    - progressSnapshot
    - learningCurveData
    - per card learningStats
. Removed a bug from FlashCard end session where the learning curve data was 
  not being refreshed properly.
. If the user has answerd an question such that the next action does not purge
  it from the session (next action > 0). In such a case, should the user be
  - Allowed to score points for subsequent ratings?
    - No, points are scored only on the first attempt. Subsequent attempts are
      for practice and since short term memory kicks in, it is not a fair test
  - Allowed to move out of the level in the session?
    - No, the card stays at the level.
. Track points lost within a session and show in end page
. Implement 'apply level to all cards' on click action
